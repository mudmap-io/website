After careful consideration, I've made the difficult decision to shut down Mudmap. The service will officially cease
operations on December 15, 2024.

## What This Means

- As of **today**, we are no longer accepting new registrations
- Existing users will maintain full access until the shutdown date
- On December 15, 2024, all services will be suspended

## Looking Forward

For those wondering about alternatives, I recommend exploring Netgate's upcoming central management solution, which I
believe will serve as a robust replacement for Mudmap's functionality.

## A Personal Note

Building and maintaining Mudmap has been a journey that wouldn't have been possible without the trust and support of our
users. While passion drove the project's initial development, circumstances have evolved. The time and dedication
required to maintain a service of this nature at the level our users deserve has become increasingly challenging to
sustain.

## Thank You

I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who gave Mudmap a chance. Your trust, feedback, and support have
meant the world to me. The decision to close wasn't easy, but I believe it's the right choice to ensure users can
transition to a well-maintained, long-term solution.

To our loyal users: thank you for being part of this journey. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

For any questions or concerns about the shutdown, please don't hesitate to reach out.
