It has been a busy few days with a lot of new developments for Mudmap. Only days 
after the release of static IP addresses for your SSH connections, I'm 
announcing several other enhancements.

## The Free Tier

Recently I have been thinking about the value metric and on-boarding flow 
for Mudmap. This platform is relatively new and lacks the social proof 
often seen on other sites. It does not offer a free trial, and I'm 
unlikely to ever do so. This can make new users weary, I mean, *what* 
exactly am I paying for and how do I know if it's a good fit.

Going forward, all accounts will be able to connect *two* devices for **free**. 
No time limits, no credit card up-front, just register with Mudmap and try 
it out. Only when you attempt to register your third device will you be 
prompted to subscribe.

Try it out today.

### Interested in being a beta tester?

I am also offering a 3-month trial for the first *ten* beta testers. All I 
ask in return is feedback and open dialogue. If this is something you're 
interested in get in [contact][beta].


## Dashboard: Getting Started

Now when logging into the dashboard for the first time, instead of an empty table, you will be greeted with a page full of useful links.

The big introduction here, is to the [documentation][docs] pages. If you're just starting out or a long time user, the [documentation][docs] should always be your first port of call for any questions. It is also updated frequently. 

## Feature Request: Firewall Rules

This is in progress and due for delivery in July 2021. Here is a teaser of what its going to look like.

As soon as it is in general availabililty there will be an annoucement, so keep informed by subscribing to the [newsletter] if you haven't already.


## News and Updates

Mudmap is now on [LinkedIn] so be sure to follow the page for future updates as well. A [roadmap] has also been created and will be updated as new features are released. This is also a good way to engage and ask for features - is there something missing that you would like to see. If so, reach out and get it added to the roadmap.
