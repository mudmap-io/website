            I reserve the right to update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever a
significant change is made to the policies, it will also be announced on the 
            <span> <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link></span>

          </p>

          <p>
When you use this service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest
Terms of Service. That’s true for any of our existing and future products and
all features that are added to the service over time. There may be times where
I do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in
doing so, I am not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a
limitation of our liability.
          </p>
          <p>
If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service.
Violation of any of the terms below may result in the termination of your
account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust
in this service. Know that the best care and thought is taken to earn and
deserve that trust by being open about who runs this, how it works, and keeping
            an open door to your <Link href="/contact">feedback</Link>
          </p>
          <h2>Account Terms</h2>
          <p>
           You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
and password. The Mudmap Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. This includes
private and public keys, as well as the overall security posture of your
network devices. You, the end-user, are responsible for your security on your
devices
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (even by
others who have their own logins under your account).
          </p>
          <p>
            You may not use this service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in
            your jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must provide your legal full name and a valid email address in order to
            complete the signup process.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are
not permitted.
          </p>

          <h2>Payments, refunds, upgrading and downgrading payment plans</h2>
          <p>
Inactive unpaid accounts with no activity from a human will be queued for
auto-cancellation and deletion after 60 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paying customers are billed automatically via credit card, or any other payment
gateway that has been included on this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will only ever pay for active devices in accordance with the general
            subscription guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-payment for active devices during an invoiced period will prompt payment
reminders before reducing the feedback from devices. Grace period of
non-payment is 7 days after which the account will no longer receive updates
from devices, or be able to send data to devices. After 60 days of non-payment
accounts will be queued for termination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paddle is the payment processor for Mudmap. Paddle also handles all the taxation requirements,
            as well as currency related expenses. Issues relating to payments are to be channeled through
            Paddle either through Mudmap first, or directly. Mudmap holds <span className="text-black">no payment information </span>
            for any customers.
          </p>
          <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for properly canceling
your account. An email to cancel your account without confirmation is not
considered cancellation. Cancellations are no questions asked. You are free to
leave at anytime, if you do wish to pass on why, or critique Mudmap, I would
love to <Link href="/contact">hear</Link> from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your
cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you
will not be charged again. All of your information will be inaccessible from
the service after the time you paid for expires. Within 60 days of that, all
information will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover
this information once it has been permanently deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to delete your account then all of your information will be
purged immediately. No information will be recoverable from the time you
request deletion
          </p>
          <p>
            Mudmap reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time. Such
termination of the service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your
account or your access to your account and device information. Mudmap reserves
the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. This clause
exists because statistically speaking, there may be at least one account
abusing the service by doing something nefarious
          </p>
          <p>
            Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or
retribution) of any service customer, company employee or officer may result in
immediate account termination. This isn't social media, you are speaking with
people trying to offer you a great service. Let's communicate like human's used
only fifteen years ago.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to Services or Prices</h2>
          <p>
            Mudmap reserves the right at any time and from
time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of
the service with or without notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes it is necessary to change the pricing structure of products or
services available. When this happens, where possible, existing customers will
be shielded from those changes. However, there may be times where existing
customers pricing changes as well. In such cases, existing customers will be
given at least 30 days notice via your on file email address. Changes may also
be communicated via other means such as blog posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mudmap is not liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price
change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.
          </p>
          <h2>

          </h2>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for any
content and other material that you submit, publish, transmit, email, or
display on, through, or with the service.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is
associated with The Mudmap Company.
